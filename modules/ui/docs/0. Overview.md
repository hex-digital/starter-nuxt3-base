# UI Module

The UI module adds new functionality relating to the User Interface.

This includes:

- Modals
- Notification pop-ups

## Ease of Use

There's an `index.ts` file inside the root of the `ui` directory. This exports the composables
and other parts of the UI feature.

This allows us to shorten the import statement for the ui feature. E.G.:

```typescript
// before
import useUiModal from '~/modules/ui/Modals/composables/useUiModal'
// after
import { useUiModal } from '~/modules/ui'
```
