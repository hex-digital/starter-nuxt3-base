> Start by reading the Nuxt Concepts guide to learn about Nuxt concepts first: https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/introduction/

This repository follows the Hex standard architecture for Nuxt-powered websites. That means it:

- Has several layers that split the application, including API, Service and UI
- Splits and co-locates code by modules
- Separates website dependencies and code from developer tooling, such as testing and documentation

Furthermore, it was scaffolded from the [`hex-digital/starter-nuxt3-base` repository](https://github.com/hex-digital/starter-nuxt3-base).

This means it comes with, or can easily be given, UI and features written to work with this starter and structure. Examples include:

- Global Modals Controller and composable, for opening and closing Modals
- Global Notifications Controller and composable, for showing Notifications to the user
- A Logger that can be used anywhere in the application, and extended to be used with other logging services in Production
- DX integrations, such as Vitest, Cypress, Storybook, code linting, etc.

The rest of this documentation details the application structure in more detail. 

Start with the rest of the Concepts in this guide:

[Read about the application structure](./1.%20Application%20Structure.md)  
[Read about the application modules](./2.%20App%20Modules.md)

Or move on to the rest of the Guide:
