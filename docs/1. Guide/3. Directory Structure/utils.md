# Guide > Directory Structure > Utils

The Utils directory (short for Utilities) is for any global utilities that our application needs.

This could be for turning a Title into a Slug, adding or removing VAT from a price, or adding Cache-Control headers.

Some App Modules in the `~/app-modules` directory may bring along their own utilities that are specific to their module.
