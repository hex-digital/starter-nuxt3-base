# Guide > Directory Structure > Types

This directory contains typescript type files only. Ones that are global to the application,
and not part of a specific feature, would usually live here.

If you have types that are more specific to your [app's modules](../../../app-modules), you may find yourself
adding a `types` directory under the feature, with feature-specific types in there instead.
