# Getting Started > Quick Start

## Prerequisites

Node 16+ (`node -v`)  
Yarn 1.22+ (`yarn -v`)

## Setup

Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.dist` file:

```
cp .env.dist .env
```

Install the node modules using `yarn`:

```
yarn install
```

## Start up

The app has two build modes: development and production.

Start the dev server for watching and hot module reloading:

```
yarn dev -o 
# The -o flag opens a new browser window automatically. Remove if you already have a window open
```

Or build for production and run the production server:

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

## Next Steps

Now that you're up and running, you are ready to start building more of this application.
