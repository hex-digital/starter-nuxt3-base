# Getting Started > Quick Start

## Prerequisites

Node 16+ (`node -v`)  
Yarn 1.22+ (`yarn -v`)

## Setup /src directory

First, ensure you're within the `/src` directory:

```
cd src
```

Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.dist` file, then edit this with your own values, or get them from another developer:

```
cp .env.dist .env
```

And lastly ensure you've installed the node modules using `yarn`:

```
yarn install
```

### Start up

The app has two build modes: development and production.

Start the dev server for watching and hot module reloading:

```
yarn dev -o 
# The -o flag opens a new browser window automatically. Remove if you already have a window open
```

Or build for production and run the production server:

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Next Steps

Now that you're up and running, you are ready to start building more of this application.

- Learn about the [application concepts](../1.%20Guide/1.%20Concepts/0.%20Overview.md)
- Learn about the [application features](../1.%20Guide/2.%20Features/0.%20Overview.md)
- Learn about the [directory structure](../1.%20Guide/3.%20Directory%20Structure/0.%20Overview.md)

## Global Setup

Note that it is possible to install all node_modules in all sub-directories from the root of this project directory.

```
yarn install:all
```

If you haven't set your `.env` files up already, you will likely receive errors from this method due to some post-install scripts.
