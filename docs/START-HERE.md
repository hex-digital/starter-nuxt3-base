# Documentation

Hello, and welcome to the Documentation.

These docs are split into 4 sections: Getting Started, Guide, Examples and Technical Reference.

[Getting Started] has all the information you need to install and run the software locally. It may also contain migration guides or any extra information related to running the application.

[The Guide] aims to be a logical journey through the sections of this application, breaking each of them down into bite-sized increments.

[The Examples] aim to show you how to implement common problems, sometimes reaching across features within an application.

[Technical Reference] has documentation on actual technical implementation, API schemas, codebase dependencies, and any
other technical information that would be good to know.
