# Nuxt 3 Base - Hex Starter

A starter for a base Nuxt3 site, without UI bells and whistles.

Most other starters are derived from this one

- A solid application architecture, ready to section application code by modules.
- Barebones base components, with little-to-no UI theming. Customise as you like, knowing the basics are covered.
- Set up for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- Pre-integrated with [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).
- Pre-integrated with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and PostCSS plugins configured.
- [Documentation](./docs) to detail how it all works, and why.

## Attribution

Thank you to numerous open source projects from which we've pulled ideas, inspiration and implementation for
features and code.

- [Vue Storefront](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront) for some excellent Nuxt composables, app structure and blog tutorials where we learnt alot.

And so much gratitude to the whole open source community for the many years of open source software
we've built upon. Standing on the shoulders of absolute giants. ðŸ’ª
